## Managing Work

Work is broken down into work-specific, sprint-like _projects_ to accomplish key results. Each project has a corresponding [organization-wide GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects) and an associated deadline.

Projects should ideally exist for no longer than 30 days and cannot contain subprojects. Once a project's deadline is passed, it should be closed (not deleted). Long-term projects should be broken down into more managable chunks.

[The main GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/hackclub/projects/2) tracks the progress of projects.
